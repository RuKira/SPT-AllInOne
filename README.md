This application is not finished, and is likely 6-8 months off, as I learn WPF - not the best with XAML.

However I am making an application that does a lot of things.
My main goal overall is to have a full usable one in all application.

If you remember a person called Dirtbikercj (Still active in SPT) - He was working on a project in Python (That I am remaking in C#) to handle quest making, and custom trader creation.
He has then gave me full access to his repo, (me being the only one) and permission to remake it all.

---
My end goal here - and something I feel is missing from SVM:

Quest Editing (default/custom quest)

Quest Creation (This will either use VCQL or MMCQL)

Item Editing (Better Version)

Trader Creation (You can opt to make a custom trader over my built in one and the app will do it all for you)

Fully interactive app (For now I have a prototype that needs lots of edits)

- As of right now, I don't like the current UI I have, but I'm too dumb to change it

Auto Item ID (I want to assign ID's in app, that way you can search for items, instead of ID's, and it does it all for you)

Preset Builder / Export

and more

# Requested Features:

Linux Support

Arm64 Support

One more thing, if you feel like you can help, I do welcome it.
This is a large project, and I'm not fully accustomed to SPT / SIT stuff - thus I am learning as I go.
As of right now I am just making a application, I've not even started the Mod development yet.

And I have no direct path, if you feel something would fit in this project I won't decline it - I only ask that you run it by me so we can do this together.

As this project get's bigger I might have to make a text channel / discord for it just to keep track of stuff but that's the far future.
